        A Bank Account can be edited thoroughly. When it is edited, everything attached to it should also be edited.
        So if a Bank Account named <strong>Ace</strong> becomes <strong>Apex</strong>, every <strong>Cash Transaction</strong>
        that was created with <strong>Ace</strong> will now become <strong>Apex</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="py-2">
        A Bank Account has some columns that cannot be edited because they are automatically calculated.
        These are <strong>balance</strong>, <strong>count of cash transactions</strong>, and <strong>sum of cash transactions</strong>.
        Although <strong>30/Fev</strong> can already be used in a fairly functional way, I do not recommend relying on <strong>balance</strong>.
        I still have not implemented a way to tell the balance of each bank account without registering transfers between one`s own accounts (
        which I also do not recommend for how complex and honestly, tedious, this can become).
